# nested-object

Certainly! Here's an example implementation of a function in Python that takes a nested object and a key and returns the corresponding value. The function uses recursion to traverse the nested object and locate the desired value.

```python
def get_value_from_nested_object(nested_object, key):
    keys = key.split('/')

    def get_value(obj, keys):
        if not keys:
            return obj
        elif isinstance(obj, dict) and keys[0] in obj:
            return get_value(obj[keys[0]], keys[1:])
        else:
            return None

    return get_value(nested_object, keys)
```

Example usage:

```python
object1 = {"a": {"b": {"c": "d"}}}
key1 = "a/b/c"
value1 = get_value_from_nested_object(object1, key1)
print(value1)  # Output: d

object2 = {"x": {"y": {"z": "a"}}}
key2 = "x/y/z"
value2 = get_value_from_nested_object(object2, key2)
print(value2)  # Output: a
```

Explanation:

1. The `get_value_from_nested_object` function takes two parameters: `nested_object` (the nested object) and `key` (the key to retrieve the value).

2. The `keys` variable is created by splitting the input `key` on the '/' character, creating a list of individual keys.

3. The `get_value` function is defined within the `get_value_from_nested_object` function. It takes two parameters: `obj` (the current object being processed) and `keys` (the remaining keys to traverse).

4. The function first checks if there are no more keys remaining (`if not keys`). In this case, it returns the current object `obj`, indicating that the desired value has been found.

5. If there are remaining keys and the current object is a dictionary (`isinstance(obj, dict)`) and the current key exists in the object (`keys[0] in obj`), it recursively calls itself with the next object to traverse (`obj[keys[0]]`) and the remaining keys (`keys[1:]`).

6. If none of the above conditions are met, indicating that the desired value was not found, it returns `None`.

7. Finally, the `get_value_from_nested_object` function is called with the `nested_object` and `key` arguments, and the returned value is printed.

This implementation provides a simple and recursive approach to retrieve a value from a nested object using a given key. It handles cases where the nested object is a dictionary and the key is provided as a string with nested keys separated by '/'. It also returns `None` if the desired value is not found.
